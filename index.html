    <p>The beginning of December 2017
        I downloaded a secure messaging
        app called 'Signal', and was
        immediately messaged by a friend
        I haven't talked to in over a 
        decade.  He then connected me 
        with another mutual friend who 
        is in the information security
        industry as a pen tester.  He 
        and I got to chatting and I
        informed him of my aspirations
        to become the worlds most elite
        superhacker, and he proceeded
        to give me the advice he wish 
        he had.
    </p>
    <p>I strted by going to a local
        infosec meetup called STLSEC
        which turned out to be more of
        an industry get together and
        drink/tell war stories.  I was
        able to meet a few very helpful
        people who made some
        recommendations on potential 
        starting points for this journey.
        A nice man who is responsible
        for infosec at "Sava-a-lot"
        told me about this awesome
        program called "Launchcode"
        and all of the doors that it
        can open to me.
    </p>

    <p>I went home and the next day
        did a bit of research on my own
        and really liked what I saw.  On
        the spot I decided to take the 
        placement/aptitude test and 
        register to try and get accepted
        to the next session which was 
        soon to start.   I hit submit and
        wished myself luck, then in the
        meantime decided that I could get
        started on my own, and completed
        the Intro to Python section a 
        day or two before receiving the 
        notification that I was accepted
        to the next session!
